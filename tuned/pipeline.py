"""The fitted model: prior, two evidence channels, and the wafer-rate loop.

    logit P(fail_i) = logit(pi_i)  +  f_param(s_i)  +  f_block(b_i)
    pi_i            = min(rate_w * h_i, 0.4)

``h_i`` is the pre-test hazard shape, ``rate_w`` the wafer's own base rate, and
the two ``f`` are smooth functions of one sufficient statistic each.  Every term
is estimated: the direction behind ``s`` and the weights behind ``b`` from the
training labels, the shapes of the two ``f`` from the same, and ``rate_w`` from
the wafer's own dies with no labels at all.

The one structural liberty is that ``h_i`` is allowed a correction.  The
generator's bracket ``1 + 3*density + 1.5*radius`` is reconstructed from the die
list rather than from the wafer-map array, so it can be slightly off; a smooth
term in ``log h`` plus a few spatial covariates absorbs the difference.  The
correction belongs to the *prior*: it multiplies ``h`` before the rate is
recovered, instead of being mistaken for something a die's own measurements
said.  Getting that split wrong double-counts the neighbourhood, because the
generator also leaks the local defect density into every parametric measurement.

The head is fitted **once**, against the population rate, and the per-wafer rate
is applied only when scoring.  That is not a shortcut: the evidence functions
describe what a die's own measurements say, which does not depend on the prior
they are later added to.  Re-fitting the head against offsets derived from each
wafer's own unlabelled rate estimate lets the wafer level feed back into the head
that produced it, and the ablations measure the cost -- a second pass is worse on
12 of 15 folds, a third is worse on 15 of 15.

Interfaces take the 500 measurements as a bare float32 matrix plus a row mask,
never a sliced copy: fifteen folds of 190,000 x 500 copies do not fit in memory
beside everything else.

        side and the evidence side without changing a single fitted probability.
        The rate step is not indifferent to it, because it reads the evidence as
        a likelihood ratio.  So something outside the head has to decide.

        ``match_count`` -- the default -- bisects until the posterior predicts
        the number of failures the training wafers actually had.  That is one
        aggregate over 150,000 dies, and it is the identity that has to hold:
        a model whose probabilities do not sum to the failures it has seen is
        not reporting probabilities.

        ``none`` leaves the intercept on the prior side.  It ranks *better* --
        by 0.0012 average precision, on 13 of 15 folds -- and it is not shipped,
        because of what the ranking is bought with: its probabilities sum to 46%
        of the actual failures, and the per-wafer rates it recovers correlate
        with the drawn ones at 0.70 instead of 0.93.  Leaving the intercept out
        of the evidence quietly shrinks the wafer-rate term, which is the same
        trade ``mrf.calibrate`` makes deliberately with ``alpha = 0.5``.  A
        shrunk wafer effect does rank slightly better here; it is still an
        accident of where a constant landed rather than a decision, and it costs
        the one claim this model makes that a fab would act on.

        ``mean_exp`` uses the textbook identity -- a likelihood ratio averages
        to one over the passing class -- and is the worst of the three, because
        ``exp(evidence)`` reaches ``e^16`` on the clearest failures and the
